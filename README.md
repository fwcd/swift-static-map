# Swift Static Map

[![Build](https://github.com/fwcd/swift-static-map/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fwcd/swift-static-map/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A small library for generating static maps directly from OpenStreetMap tiles.

The implementation is based on a port of [danielalvsaaker](https://github.com/danielalvsaaker)'s [`staticmap`](https://github.com/danielalvsaaker/staticmap) library for Rust.
